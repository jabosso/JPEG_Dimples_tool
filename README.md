### Preface
The following tool is developed based on the [Agarwal and Farid paper](https://github.com/jabosso/JPEG_Dimples_tool/blob/main/Agarwal_Farid.pdf) , in which the authors analyze jpeg dimples artifact and propose a pipeline to use it in forensics task.
The paper was studied and analyzed in order to higlight the main points, wich were exposed in [slides](https://github.com/jabosso/JPEG_Dimples_tool/blob/main/JPEG_DIMPLES_slide.pdf).

### Code
